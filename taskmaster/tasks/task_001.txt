# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set Up Basic Substrate Node Structure with pallet-staking-atlas for Aura-R DPoS
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish the foundational Substrate node architecture and implement the pallet-staking-atlas module to support Aura-R Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
This task involves setting up the core Substrate node structure and implementing the pallet-staking-atlas module for Aura-R DPoS:

1. Initialize a new Substrate node project using the Substrate Node Template:
   ```bash
   cargo install subkey --force
   cargo install substrate-node-template --force
   substrate-node-template new my-aura-r-node
   cd my-aura-r-node
   ```

2. Configure the runtime to include necessary dependencies in Cargo.toml:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   # Substrate dependencies
   pallet-staking = { default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.x" }
   pallet-session = { default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.x" }
   pallet-aura = { default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.x" }
   # Custom pallet for Aura-R DPoS
   pallet-staking-atlas = { path = "../pallets/staking-atlas", default-features = false, version = "1.0.0" }
   ```

3. Create the pallet-staking-atlas directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p pallets/staking-atlas/src
   touch pallets/staking-atlas/Cargo.toml
   touch pallets/staking-atlas/src/lib.rs
   ```

4. Implement the pallet-staking-atlas module with the following core components:
   - Validator selection mechanism based on stake
   - Delegation functionality for token holders
   - Reward distribution system
   - Slashing conditions for misbehavior
   - Era transition logic

5. Implement the Aura-R DPoS consensus mechanism by extending the standard Aura consensus with reputation-based validator selection:
   - Define reputation metrics based on validator performance
   - Implement reputation score calculation
   - Integrate reputation scores with validator selection

6. Configure the node's chain specification to use the Aura-R DPoS consensus:
   - Set initial validators
   - Define staking parameters (minimum stake, reward rate, etc.)
   - Configure era duration and session length

7. Integrate the pallet-staking-atlas with the runtime by adding it to the construct_runtime! macro and implementing its Config trait.

8. Implement necessary RPC methods to query staking information, validator set, and delegation status.

9. Document the architecture and configuration options for the staking module.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all functions in the pallet-staking-atlas module
   - Test validator selection logic with various stake distributions
   - Test delegation mechanics and reward calculations
   - Test slashing mechanisms under different violation scenarios
   - Test reputation score calculations with simulated validator behaviors

2. Integration Testing:
   - Create a test runtime that includes the pallet-staking-atlas
   - Test interactions between staking, session, and consensus modules
   - Verify correct validator set updates at session boundaries
   - Test era transitions and reward distributions

3. Runtime Verification:
   - Deploy a local testnet with multiple nodes
   - Configure nodes with different stake amounts and reputation scores
   - Verify validator selection matches expected outcomes based on stake and reputation
   - Test network behavior during validator rotation

4. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark validator selection algorithm efficiency
   - Measure block production times with various validator set sizes
   - Test system under high transaction load to ensure consensus stability

5. Security Testing:
   - Attempt to exploit the staking system with malicious inputs
   - Test slashing conditions to ensure they trigger appropriately
   - Verify that validators cannot manipulate reputation scores

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - The node successfully builds and runs with the pallet-staking-atlas module
   - Validators are selected according to the Aura-R DPoS rules specified in the PRD
   - Delegations properly affect validator selection
   - Rewards are distributed correctly at the end of each era
   - Reputation scores accurately reflect validator performance
   - The system maintains consensus during validator set changes

We have started implementing the core structure of the pallet-staking-atlas module. The basic directory and file structure has been created:

1. Directory structure for the project:
   ```
   atlas2/
   └── node/
       ├── Cargo.toml (configured dependencies for the main node)
       └── src/
           ├── main.rs (basic structure for the node entry point)
           └── pallets/
               ├── staking-atlas/
               │   ├── Cargo.toml (configured dependencies for the staking-atlas pallet)
               │   └── src/
               │       └── lib.rs (defined core data types and structures)
               ├── balances/
               │   ├── Cargo.toml
               │   └── src/
               │       └── lib.rs (extension of standard pallet-balances for public ledger)
               └── shielded-pool/
                   ├── Cargo.toml
                   └── src/
                       └── lib.rs (implementation of private transactions using ZK-SNARKs)
   ```

2. In lib.rs for pallet-staking-atlas, we have defined:
   - ReputationScore and Validator types for storing validator information and reputation
   - Delegator type for managing delegations
   - Config structure for pallet configuration
   - Basic pallet structure using the #[frame_support::pallet] macro

3. The staking-atlas pallet depends on the following Substrate components:
   - frame-support and frame-system for core pallet functionality
   - pallet-session for validator session management
   - pallet-staking as the base staking implementation

Next steps will be:
1. Implementing storage structures for validators, delegators, and stakes
2. Defining events for staking actions
3. Defining error types
4. Implementing initialization and finalization hooks

2. Main components implemented so far:
   - Validator state storage in storage::Validators
   - Delegator state storage in storage::Delegators
   - Management of validator and delegator stakes
   - Token locking during staking and delegation
   - Validator status management through ValidatorStatuses

3. Events defined that are generated when:
   - a validator registers (ValidatorRegistered)
   - a validator deregisters (ValidatorDeregistered)
   - a delegation is created (DelegationCreated)
   - stake changes (ValidatorStakeIncreased, ValidatorStakeDecreased)
   - reputation score updates (ReputationUpdated)

Next steps to complete this subtask:
