# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Basic Block Explorer for Transaction Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a web-based block explorer that displays public transactions and metadata of private transactions, allowing users to search and view blockchain activity while maintaining privacy guarantees.
# Details:
This task involves developing a block explorer interface that provides transparency while respecting privacy requirements:

1. Set up a React-based frontend project:
```bash
npx create-react-app aura-block-explorer
cd aura-block-explorer
npm install @polkadot/api @polkadot/extension-dapp axios react-router-dom styled-components
```

2. Implement the core block explorer components:
   - Block list view showing recent blocks with timestamps, hash, and transaction count
   - Block detail view showing all transactions in a block
   - Transaction detail view with different displays for public and private transactions
   - Search functionality by block number, block hash, transaction hash, or account address

3. For public transactions, display:
   - Transaction hash
   - Block number and timestamp
   - Sender and recipient addresses
   - Transaction amount and fees
   - Transaction status (confirmed, pending)
   - Any additional transaction metadata

4. For private transactions, display limited metadata:
   - Transaction hash
   - Block number and timestamp
   - Transaction type (shield, unshield, private transfer)
   - Nullifier hash (without revealing actual values)
   - Commitment hash (without revealing actual values)
   - ZK-proof verification status
   - For unshield transactions that have been processed, show the public recipient and amount

5. Implement API services to interact with the blockchain:
```javascript
// src/services/api.js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

let api = null;

export const initializeApi = async () => {
  if (!api) {
    const wsProvider = new WsProvider('ws://localhost:9944');
    api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });
  }
  return api;
};

export const getLatestBlocks = async (count = 10) => {
  const api = await initializeApi();
  const latestBlockNumber = await api.derive.chain.bestNumber();
  
  const blocks = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    const blockNumber = latestBlockNumber.toNumber() - i;
    if (blockNumber < 0) break;
    
    const blockHash = await api.rpc.chain.getBlockHash(blockNumber);
    const block = await api.rpc.chain.getBlock(blockHash);
    const timestamp = await getBlockTimestamp(blockHash);
    
    blocks.push({
      number: blockNumber,
      hash: blockHash.toString(),
      timestamp,
      txCount: block.block.extrinsics.length - 1 // Subtract 1 to exclude the timestamp extrinsic
    });
  }
  
  return blocks;
};

export const getBlockDetails = async (blockHashOrNumber) => {
  // Implementation details
};

export const getTransactionDetails = async (txHash) => {
  // Implementation details
};

export const getShieldedPoolState = async () => {
  // Get nullifier set and commitment set sizes
};
```

6. Create components for visualizing the blockchain data:
   - BlockList.js - Paginated list of recent blocks
   - BlockDetails.js - Detailed view of a specific block
   - TransactionDetails.js - Detailed view of a transaction
   - SearchBar.js - Search functionality across the blockchain
   - Dashboard.js - Overview statistics of the blockchain

7. Implement a specialized component for visualizing the shielded pool state:
```javascript
// src/components/ShieldedPoolStats.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { getShieldedPoolState } from '../services/api';

const ShieldedPoolStats = () => {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState({
    nullifierSetSize: 0,
    commitmentSetSize: 0,
    pendingUnshields: 0
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const data = await getShieldedPoolState();
      setStats(data);
    };
    
    fetchData();
    const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 30000); // Update every 30 seconds
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="shielded-pool-stats">
      <h3>Shielded Pool Statistics</h3>
      <div className="stats-grid">
        <div className="stat-item">
          <span className="stat-label">Nullifiers:</span>
          <span className="stat-value">{stats.nullifierSetSize}</span>
        </div>
        <div className="stat-item">
          <span className="stat-label">Commitments:</span>
          <span className="stat-value">{stats.commitmentSetSize}</span>
        </div>
        <div className="stat-item">
          <span className="stat-label">Pending Unshields:</span>
          <span className="stat-value">{stats.pendingUnshields}</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ShieldedPoolStats;
```

8. Implement responsive design to ensure usability across desktop and mobile devices.

9. Add documentation pages explaining:
   - How to interpret transaction data
   - Privacy features and what information is deliberately not shown
   - How to use the explorer effectively

10. Deploy the block explorer to a web server with appropriate caching and performance optimizations.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the correct implementation of the block explorer:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify that the block explorer correctly displays the latest blocks on the homepage
   - Test the search functionality with various inputs:
     - Valid block numbers
     - Valid transaction hashes
     - Valid account addresses
     - Invalid/malformed inputs (should show appropriate error messages)
   - Confirm that block details page shows all transactions within the block
   - Verify that transaction details are displayed correctly for different transaction types

2. Privacy Testing:
   - Confirm that private transaction details only show metadata and not actual values
   - Verify that nullifiers and commitments are displayed as hashes only
   - Ensure that no private keys or viewing keys are ever requested or displayed
   - Test that unshielded transactions only show public information after they've been processed

3. Integration Testing:
   - Test the block explorer against a local development network:
     - Generate various transaction types (public transfers, shield, unshield, private transfers)
     - Verify that all transactions appear correctly in the explorer
   - Test against a testnet environment with real network conditions
   - Verify that the explorer correctly handles network latency and reconnection

4. Performance Testing:
   - Test loading times for the main page and block details pages
   - Verify that pagination works correctly for large result sets
   - Test the explorer's performance when displaying blocks with many transactions
   - Ensure that real-time updates don't cause performance degradation

5. UI/UX Testing:
   - Test the responsive design on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Verify that all interactive elements are accessible and function correctly
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation for accessibility
   - Verify that error states are clearly communicated to users

6. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test the explorer in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Verify that all functionality works consistently across browsers

7. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create automated tests that simulate user journeys:
     - Searching for a transaction and viewing its details
     - Browsing through multiple blocks
     - Viewing account history
   - Verify that all links between different views work correctly

8. Security Testing:
   - Verify that the explorer doesn't expose any sensitive information
   - Test input validation to prevent XSS or injection attacks
   - Ensure that API requests are properly rate-limited to prevent abuse
